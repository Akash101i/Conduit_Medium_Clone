# Conduit_Medium_Clone
It's a realworld Android Project called Conduit_Medium_Clone based on realworld.io in Kotlin language. I've used MVVM software architecture and RecyclerView for list and all. Created an API library with Retrofit library for API calls and MOSHI library for converting Jason to Kotlin.
